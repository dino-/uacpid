# event is a regexp used for matching the raw string that we get from acpid
# These strings look like:
#   button/lid LID 00000080 00000002
#   button/sleep SLPB 00000080 00000001
#   hotkey ATKD 00000062 00000000
# See acpid for more info
event=.*

# action is a shell command that will be executed if the above event 
# regexp pattern is a match
# This example using logger will log to local syslog-ng
# You can see these messages in /var/log/messages.log
# (just as an example)
action=logger "uacpid event handler: anything"

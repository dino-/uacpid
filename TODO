- Make arch PKGBUILD, see cabal2arch

- Can some of the code in main.hs be factored into other modules? Maybe Uacpid.Signals to start with

- Various types of failures in event handler scripts will generate WARNING priority log messages

- If the event handler script's shell process fails, we need to log the exit code. WARNING priority, of course.

- This project needs a real man page

- Need signal support for sigHUP. What this means is being able to stop and restart the socket connection parts. Some redesign, I think.

- What event scripts will ship with this? Can we do any kind of generic example one like acpid's anything handler? What would anything do?

- Need some basic cli arg handling to respond to --version

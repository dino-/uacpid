- Can some of the code in main.hs be factored into other modules? Maybe Uacpid.Signals to start with

- If the event handler script's shell process fails, we need to log the exit code. WARNING priority. The real question here is do we have any business waiting for the shell process to come back? Maybe just report on failure to launch?

- Need to be careful about when acpid is stopped and the socket goes away on a running uacpid. Must deal with this gracefully.

- If acpid has run but is not now running, the socket file in /var/run/ can still be there. What happens then is that the connection is refused and you get no message in the uacpid log. You do get a message to stderr, but this is likely to be missed when running from .xinitrc  Need to fix this soon.

- Add version number output to logging when daemon is started

- Need to develop a simulator event server to use for automated testing and development

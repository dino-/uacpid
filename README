Getting started developing:

This daemon is designed to make files for itself in ~/.uacpid/ the
first time it's run. To assist with development, there is a script
which will build a development installation and execution environment
in /tmp/uacpid-dev/ for you.


To initialize for development:

   $ bin/uacpid-dev-setup


Once that's completed, it can be run like this:

   $ bin/uacpid-dev

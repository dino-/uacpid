uacpid is a daemon designed to be run in userspace that will monitor the local system's acpid socket for hardware events. These events can then be acted upon by handlers with access to the user's environment.

uacpid is available in binary form for Arch Linux through the AUR and can be acquired using darcs or other methods. See the project page below for more.
